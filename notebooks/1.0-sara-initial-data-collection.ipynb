    "In this library we use the Twitter standard search API, which returns a collection of relevant Tweets matching a specified query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Search API is not meant to be an exhaustive source of Tweets. **Not all Tweets will be indexed or made available via the search interface**.\n",

    "https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/timelines/guides/working-with-timelines\n",
    "\n",
    "The Twitter API has several methods, such as GET statuses/user_timeline and GET statuses/home_timeline, which return a timeline of Tweet data. Such timelines can grow very large, so there are limits to how much of a timeline a client application may fetch in a single request. Applications must therefore iterate through timeline results in order to build a more complete list."
